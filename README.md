# Card cabinet

This repository is a library for use in Go.

Card cabinet is a simple note system of regular markdown files with properties in frontmatter coupled with boards that collect cards in different views.

The cards (files) are fairly stand alone, leaving the boards to link or structure cards based on labels or other 
properties.

## Non goals

Card cabinet is **not** a system where cards can reference each other in a infinite hierarchy like [Org mode](orgmode.org) or [Roam](roamresearch.com). The idea here is to actually move relationships from cards to boards.
